🏦📈 **NVIDIA Stock Analysis: 1999–2024**

Have you ever wondered how NVIDIA grew from a GPU company into an AI powerhouse and how that affected its stock price? I wanted to explore exactly that. From historical trends to spikes and dips, I analyzed NVIDIA’s stock performance from 1999 to 2024 to better understand its market behavior.

🌟 **What I Did**

I aimed to answer questions like: "When did NVIDIA experience major growth or decline?" and "Which periods were the most volatile?" Using historical stock data and statistical analysis, I visualized trends, volatility, and key price movements to make sense of NVIDIA’s market history.

**Key Features**

* **Summary Statistics & Variance Analysis:** I calculated descriptive statistics, variance, and price ranges to understand the stability of NVIDIA stock over time.
* **Stock Price Visualizations:** I created line charts showing opening, closing, high, and low prices to highlight trends and key events.
* **Daily Returns:** I measured daily percentage changes to track volatility and significant price movements.
* **Top Price Difference Days:** I identified days with the largest difference between opening and closing prices to provide insights for investors.

🔨 **How I Built It**

* **Data Source:** I collected historical NVIDIA stock prices from 1999–2024, saved as CSV files.
* **Data Processing:** I used R with `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `pander` to clean, merge, and analyze the datasets.
* **Visualization:** I used line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots to show trends and volatility clearly.
* **Analysis:** I generated summary statistics, variance, price ranges, daily returns, and top difference days to extract meaningful insights.

🚧 **Challenges I Faced**

* **Large Dataset:** Combining 25 years of stock data required careful merging and cleaning.
* **Volatility Analysis:** I had to filter and format the data carefully to make charts readable.
* **Clear Visualizations:** Making the charts understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences took extra work.

🎉 **Accomplishments**

* I created a comprehensive, interactive report of NVIDIA stock history.
* I built clear visualizations to highlight trends and volatility.
* I extracted actionable insights from historical stock data for potential investors.

💡 **What I Learned**

* How to analyze long-term stock data and detect patterns.
* How to visualize historical financial data effectively using R and `ggplot2`.
* How to interpret stock volatility and market reactions to major company events.

**Data Sources**
All data files are included in the `data` folder in my repository:

* NVIDIA Stock Prices 1999–2023
* NVIDIA Stock Prices 2023–2024

I cleaned the datasets to ensure correct data types and minimal missing values.
